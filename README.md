# A machine learning approach for master patient index record linkage and deduplication

The research emphasised the vital role of a Master Patient Index (MPI) solution in addressing the challenges public healthcare facilities face in eliminating duplicate patient records and improving record linkage. The study recognised that traditional MPI systems may have limitations in terms of efficiency and accuracy. To address this, the study focused on utilising machine learning techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MPI systems, aiming to support the growing record linkage healthcare ecosystem.

It was essential to highlight that integrating machine learning into MPI systems is crucial for optimising their capabilities. The study aimed to improve data linking and deduplication processes within MPI systems by leveraging machine learning techniques. This emphasis on machine learning represented a significant shift towards more sophisticated and intelligent healthcare technologies. Ultimately, the goal was to ensure safe and efficient patient care, benefiting individuals and the broader healthcare industry.

The methodology involved investigating five machine-learning techniques: random forests, extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, stacking ensemble, and artificial neural networks. These techniques improved data linking and deduplication in an MPI system. Additionally, the impact of duplicate records on healthcare systems was examined, and practical solutions to tackle this problem were proposed.

The findings indicate that machine learning models can be highly effective for record linkage and deduplication. Furthermore, it was concluded that no single model was universally suitable for all training datasets, highlighting the need to assess the performance of each model to determine the best fit for a specific dataset.

In conclusion, the results of this research have significant implications for the healthcare industry, as they are expected to enhance the utilisation of MPI systems and improve their effectiveness in the record linkage healthcare ecosystem. By improving patient record linking and deduplication, healthcare providers can ensure safer and more efficient care, ultimately benefiting patients and the industry.
